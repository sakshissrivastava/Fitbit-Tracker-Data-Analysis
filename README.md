# Fitbit Tracker DataSet Analysis

The data set used for this analysis is available on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit style:none;>Kaggle</a>

### Task: 
Analyze FitBit fitness tracker data to gain insights into how consumers are using the FitBit app and discover trends for marketing strategy.

### About the Dataset:
1) Data is publicly available on Kaggle: FitBit Fitness Tracker Data and stored in 18 csv files.
2) Generated by respondents from a survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 12 March 2016 to 12 May 2016.
3) 30 FitBit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data.
4) Data collected includes physical activity recorded in minutes, heart rate, sleep monitoring, daily activity, steps and calories.

### Limitations:
A good dataset must ROCCC or in other words must be Reliable, Original, Comprehensive, Current, Cited. 

1) Reliable: LOW - Not reliable as it only has 30 respondents
2) Original: LOW - Generated by Third Party (Amazon Mechanical Turk)
3) Comprehensive: MED - Data minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. While the data tracks many factors in the user activity and sleep, but the sample size is small and most data is recorded during certain days of the week.
4) Current: LOW - Dataset is almost 7 years old and might not be relevant
5) Cited: LOW - Data collected from third party, hence unknown

Hence this dataset is considered bad quality and must not be used of making any business decisions.

### Tools:
Python is used for data cleaning, transformation and visulization

### CSV file used:
1) dailyActivity_merged.csv
2) sleepDay_merged.csv
3) hourlyIntensities_merged.csv

### Findings:
#### dailyActivity_merged.csv ->
 There are 33 unique Ids avaialable in the csv file.
 NO NULL values
 
Statistical Observation:
1) On average, users logged 7,637 steps or 5.4km which is not adequate. As recommended by CDC, an adult female has to aim at least 10,000 steps or 8km per day to benefit from general health, weight loss and fitness improvement.
2) Average sedentary time is 991 minutes or 16 hours which is a lot!
3) Average calories burned is 2,303 calories equivalent to 0.6 pound. Details cannot be adeuqately interpreted as calories burned depend on several factors such as the age, weight, daily tasks, exercise, hormones and daily calorie intake.
